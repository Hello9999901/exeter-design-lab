# 3D Printing FAQ

- The print is not adhering to the bed (the print is lifting off of the bed)!
  - Stop the print and remove all filament on the bed and on the nozzle. Don't touch the nozzle as it is incredibly hot. Use a small needle nose plier. Wait for the bed to cool down and use a paper towel along with some 99% isopropyl alcohol (there are bottles lying around the lab) wipe the bed down. Restart the print. If it still does not work, please contact a Design Lab proctor.

- What if something goes wrong during the print?
  - Press the "X" next to the 3D printer screen and immediately contact a Design Lab proctor.

- How do I change filament?
  - Under `Settings`, press `Unload Filament`. Once unloaded, press `Load Filament` while pressing a new strand of *prepared (pre-cut, sharp tip)* filament into the printer. Continue following instructions on the screen. If you are unfamiliar with the process, contact a Design Lab Proctor.

- Where do I put prints that are done but nobody has picked up yet?
  - Please remove it from the bed and place it next to the printer.

- Can I use the other printers that are around the lab?
  - Unfortunately, they are very difficult to use and inconsistent. Please stick to the Prusas.

- Oh, no! I broke it! What should I do?
  - It's alright, just contact a Design Lab Proctor immediately.
